Junyi Chai
======

Greetings! 
------
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), advised by [Prof. Xiaoqian Wang](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~joywang/). Prior to this, I received my bachelor's degree from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2020.

My research focuses on trustworthy machine learning, with a particular emphasis on developing machine learning models that offer guarantees for debiasing and factuality.  I also work on the intersection of machine learning and bioinformatics, agriculture.
